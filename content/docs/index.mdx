Welcome to **Shadix UI** - an **open source** custom shadcn/ui component registry featuring enhanced components with modern animations and interactions.

## What is Shadix UI?

Shadix UI is a curated collection of React components built on top of shadcn/ui, enhanced with Framer Motion animations and custom variants. Our components are designed to provide a seamless developer experience while maintaining the flexibility and customization options you expect from shadcn/ui.

## Open Source Philosophy

ðŸš€ **Shadix UI is completely open source!** Following the shadcn/ui philosophy, our components are designed for maximum adaptability:

-   **Copy & Paste Approach** - Components are distributed as source code, not npm packages
-   **Full Customization** - Modify styles, adjust logic, or integrate with other tools
-   **No Dependencies** - Free from the limitations of traditional component libraries
-   **Community Driven** - Built by developers, for developers
-   **MIT Licensed** - Use in personal and commercial projects

## Why Choose Shadix UI?

While shadcn/ui provides excellent core components, it lacks animated variants and motion customization options. Shadix UI fills this gap by offering:

-   **Smooth Animations** - Enhanced components with Framer Motion integration
-   **Custom Variants** - Diverse styling options beyond standard shadcn/ui
-   **Modern Interactions** - Popup animations, transitions, and micro-interactions
