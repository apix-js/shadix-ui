Hey fellow developers!

If you're building with React or Next.js, you've probably heard of the incredible `shadcn/ui`. It revolutionized how we build component libraries by moving away from traditional packages and towards a copy-paste-and-own-your-code philosophy. It gives us beautiful, accessible, and unopinionated building blocks.

But as our applications grow, we often find ourselves building the same complex components over and over again on top of `shadcn/ui`'s primitives. Think of date-time pickers, reorderable lists, or even signature pads. These are common needs, but they take significant time to build, test, and maintain.

What if we could extend the `shadcn/ui` philosophy to these more complex components?

That's why we built **Shadix UI**.

### What is Shadix UI?

[**Shadix UI**](https://shadix.ui.shadcn.com) is a curated collection of advanced, ready-to-use components built on top of Shadcn/UI and Radix UI. It's designed to seamlessly integrate into your existing projects, saving you hours of development time.

We follow the same principle: you own the code. Just like `shadcn/ui`, you can use our CLI to add components directly to your codebase, giving you full control to customize them to your heart's content.

### A Glimpse of What You Can Build

We're not just talking about styled buttons. Shadix UI provides components that solve real-world UI challenges. Let's look at a few fan favorites:

#### 1. The Hassle-Free DateTimePicker

Date pickers are common, but a complete date *and* time picker that feels great to use is surprisingly hard to find. Our `DateTimePicker` is intuitive, accessible, and a breeze to integrate.

**(Suggestion: Add a screenshot or GIF of the DateTimePicker in action here)**

Getting started with it is as simple as:

```tsx
import {
  DateTimePicker,
  DateTimePickerInput,
} from "@/components/ui/datetimepicker";

export function DateTimePickerDemo() {
  return (
    <DateTimePicker>
      <DateTimePickerInput />
    </DateTimePicker>
  );
}
```

#### 2. Drag-and-Drop Reorderable Lists

Need to let your users reorder items in a list? We've got you covered. The `ReorderList` component handles the drag-and-drop logic, animations, and state management for you.

**(Suggestion: Add a screenshot or GIF of the ReorderList in action here)**

Here’s how easy it is to implement:

```tsx
import { ReorderList } from "@/components/ui/reorder-list";

export function ReorderListDemo() {
  const [items, setItems] = React.useState([
    { id: "1", label: "Item 1" },
    { id: "2", label: "Item 2" },
    { id: "3", label: "Item 3" },
  ]);

  return (
    <ReorderList items={items} onReorder={setItems} />
  );
}
```

#### 3. The Surprisingly Simple Signature Pad

Capturing user signatures on the web has always been a chore. Our `SignaturePad` component simplifies this into a plug-and-play solution, complete with callbacks to handle the output.

**(Suggestion: Add a screenshot or GIF of the SignaturePad in action here)**

```tsx
import { SignaturePad } from "@/components/ui/signature-pad";

export function SignaturePadDemo() {
  const [signature, setSignature] = React.useState<string | null>(null);

  return (
    <SignaturePad onSignatureChange={(data) => setSignature(data)} />
  );
}
```

And there's more, including:
*   `ActionButton`: A button with built-in loading and success states.
*   `MotionDialog`: A dialog component with smooth animations.
*   `ExpandableCard`: Perfect for showing a preview and expanding for more details.

### Why Not Just Build Them Myself?

You absolutely could! The beauty of `shadcn/ui` is that it empowers you to. But building these components takes time. Time for logic, styling, accessibility, and testing. Shadix UI is about community and collaboration. We've done the heavy lifting for you, so you can focus on what makes your application unique.

Think of us as the next layer in your component toolbox—a natural extension of the `shadcn/ui` ecosystem.

### Getting Started

Ready to give it a spin? Head over to our website to browse the components and read the documentation:
